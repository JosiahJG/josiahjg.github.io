        <div class="title">About Me</div>
        <p>
          I did my BSc(Hons) in mathematics at <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/sms">Victoria
          University of Wellington</a>, finishing in 2017. I also, completed the BSc requirements of
          the computer science major. It was during my undergrad that I was first introduced to
          mathematical logic. Since 2018 I have been a graduate student at University of
          Wisconsin–Madison. I am mostly interested in computability theory.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of logic I am enjoy rock climbing. I used to compete a lot when I was younger and
          even represented New Zealand at the World Youth Championships a few times. I also enjoy
          reading fiction and have been writing an epic fantasy novel for the past few years.
