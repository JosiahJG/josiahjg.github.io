        <div class="title">About Me</div>
        <p>
          I did my BSc(Hons) in mathematics at <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/sms">Victoria
          University of Wellington</a>, finishing in 2017. I also completed the BSc requirements of
          the computer science major. It was during my undergrad that I was first introduced to
          mathematical logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2018 to 2024 I did my PhD at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/">University of
                Wisconsinâ€“Madison</a>, under the supervision
                of <a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/~msoskova/">Mariya Soskova <a>. My research was
                in various areas of computability theory with a focus on the enumeration degrees and
                computable analysis and topology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of logic, I enjoy rock climbing. I used to compete a lot when I was younger and
          even represented New Zealand at the World Youth Championships a few times. I also enjoy
          reading fiction and have been writing an epic fantasy series for the past few years. I am
          currently in the process of querying literary agents and hope to have this published one
          day.
        </p>
